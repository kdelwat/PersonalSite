# Phonology

_Phonology_ is the study of the sounds of a language. In this chapter, the basic sounds, or _phonemes_, of Ngujari are outlined. These sounds change depending on their surrounding sounds, a process which will be described. Finally, the _prosody_ of the language will be considered, which incorporates sound on a level higher than individual phonemes, including stress and intonation.

## Phonemes

A central idea of phonology is the relationship between phonemes and
_allophones_. A phoneme is distinctive, meaning that two words with only one phoneme changed are considered completely different words. On the other hand, each phoneme can have multiple allophones, which are the actual sounds that results in the specific environment they are found in.

### Consonants

Ngujari has a rich _consonantal inventory_. The following table shows these consonants. The first symbol in each pair is the phoneme, expressed in International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA) notation. The following symbol, in brackets, is the written representation of that phoneme. If there is no symbol in brackets, the orthography is the same as the IPA form.

: Consonantal inventory

The _retroflex_ consonants (_rt, rn, r, rl_) are pronounced with the tongue curled back in the mouth, just behind the _alveolar ridge_, or the ridge between the roof of the mouth and the teeth.

The _coronal_ consonants are divided into two types. _Laminal_ consonants, which are indicated by a box under the phonetic representation, are created by pressing the tongue, just beyond the tip, against the roof of the mouth. The _apical_ consonants, indicated by an open box, are created the same way, except only the very tip of the tongue is used.

### Vowels

In contrast to the large number of consonants, Ngujari has very few vowels. The basic vowels are a, i, and u, but all are _contrastive_ in their lengthened form.

+----------------------+----------------------+-----------------------+
| | front | back |
+======================+======================+=======================+
| **high** | i, iː | u, uː |
+----------------------+----------------------+-----------------------+
| **low** | a, aː | |
+----------------------+----------------------+-----------------------+

: Vowel inventory

When written, the short forms are the same as their IPA representation, while the long vowels are presented as digraphs, where the short vowel is repeated twice.

## Phonotactics

_Phonotactics_ incorporates phonetic features such as sound changes (including allophones), permissible phoneme arrangements, and prosody.

### Phonological Constraints

The structure of Ngujari words is simple, with syllables taking the form CV(C): one consonant is followed by one vowel and an optional consonant (dependant on permitted consonant clusters). A root word is usually between two and four syllables long, plus any affixes, which tend to be single-syllable.

#### Consonants

The main form of phoneme restriction is found in _consonant clusters_, the allowable sequences of consonants which appear without being separated by a vowel. The following combinations are the only allowable clusters:

-   rhotic/liquid + non-retroflex nasal, (_walma_, _garrna_)

-   rhotic/liquid + non-rhotic approximant (_wiilyu_, _parlwa_)

-   rhotic/liquid + stop (_ngurpa_)

-   nasal + approximant/stop (_bantuu_)

-   approximant + stop (_gaypa_)

-   retroflex + stop (_karlpii_)

In addition, retroflex consonants are never found at the beginning of a word and approximants are never found at the end of a word.

: Permitted consonant clusters

(more specific rules trump less, e.g. non-rhotic approx &gt; retroflex)

#### Part of Speech

There are some minor phoneme restrictions which depend upon part of speech.

For verbs, as described in **morphology,** the word must fall into one of three classes. This means that it must end in _rr_, _j_, or _nn_.

Nouns must always end in a vowel, to avoid the creation of illegal consonant clusters after adding case suffixes.

## Allophonetic Rules

Sound changes apply to the _realisation_ of phonemes. While in written form the phoneme appears the same, in different circumstances it is pronounced as different allophones.

### Vowels

The _u_ phoneme becomes centralised following the bilabial consonants _p_, _m_, and _w_, (the pronunciation migrates towards the center of the mouth).

> happy _pupa_ ⇒ _püpa_
>
> food _nurtwu_ ⇒ _nuʈ̺wü_

The _i_ and _a_ phonemes are nasalised before alveolar and post-alveolar nasals.

> never _wulnni_ ⇒ _wül̺n̻ĩ_
>
> reed _kanaa_ ⇒ _kan̺ãː_

### Consonants

#### Rhotics

The retroflex approximant _r_ disappears between identical regular vowels, forming one lengthened vowel.

> adult _garanya_ ⇒ _gaːn̺ja_

However, if either of the two vowels is lengthened, the approximant remains.

> head _giriirki_ ⇒ _giɻiːʈ̺ki_

The retroflex approximant _r_ becomes the retroflex plosive _rt_ before another plosive consonant.

> wood _taarirki_ ⇒ _taːɻiʈ̺ki_

#### Voicing

The voicing process is relatively new to the language. Voicing occurs when an unvoiced plosive becomes its voiced equivalent. Recently, plosives are becoming initially voiced.

In practice, the voiced plosive _g_ is the only new voiced consonant sufficiently formed to be included as an individual phoneme; the rest are in the process of undergoing the differentiation and are known as allophones.

> to drop _gukarr_ ⇒ _gukaɾ̺_
>
> tooth _parrnawa_ ⇒ _p̬aɾn̺awa_
>
> dangerous _tuwilwa_ ⇒ _t̬uwil̺wa_

The retroflex phoneme _rt_ is an exception: as retroflex consonants cannot begin words, there has been no initial voicing.

## Historical Sound Changes

Ngujari differs phonologically from Proto-Pama-Nyungan only slightly. The following is a list of sound changes that have occurred:

-   Apicalised post-alveolar plosive (t̻) becomes voiced post-alveolar
    fricative (ʒ).

-   Apicalised alveolar trill (r̻) becomes apicalised alveolar tap (ɾ̺).

-   Retroflex approximant (ɻ) disappears between identical regular
    vowels, forming one lengthened vowel.

-   Apicalised alveolar lateral approximant (l̻) disappears from the end
    of words.

A major difference occurs in the case of lengthened vowels, which can differentiate words in all positions, rather than just the first syllable as in the protolanguage.

## Prosody

_Prosody_ is the way phonemes are spoken as a whole, including within words and sentences. Ngujari has a rich prosodic system incorporating stress, intonation, and tempo. The purely phonetic aspects of the system are dealt with here, but intonation and tempo have many pragmatic uses which are left to the **pragmatics** chapter.

### Morae

Every word can be broken into _morae_, which are calculated using syllables. A syllable containing a short vowel is worth one mora, but those containing long vowels are worth two. Syllables with one mora are known as _monomoraic_, while those with two are known as _bimoraic_.

> white _tumwaku_ ⇒ 111
>
> cloud _rrurtawalu_ ⇒ 1111
>
> egg _kupaarki_ ⇒ 121

The arrangement of mora becomes important when dealing with stress and prosody as a whole, particularly in the poetic register.

### Stress

_Stress_ is the weight placed on each syllable. A stressed syllable carries more weight than an unstressed syllable and therefore stands out.

In Ngujari, stress follows an algorithmic process. The _primary stress_ is placed on the second mora of the word. If that mora is part of the first syllable (i.e. the first syllable has a long vowel and is bimoraic, the first syllable is stressed. Otherwise, the second is stressed.

_Secondary stress_ is then placed on morae at even intervals, appearing on the syllable with the 4th mora, 6th mora, and so on. However, if two subsequent syllables would be stressed, the second is skipped.

> seal _bilru_ ⇒ _bil̺ɻuˈ_
>
> tongue _jaajannalu_ ⇒ _ʒaːˈʒan̻aˌl̺u_
>
> pride _miinaatirra_ ⇒ _miːˈn̺aːt̺iɾ̺aˌ_
