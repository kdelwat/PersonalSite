# Introduction

As the effects of climate change intensify, farmers in low-income regions of the world are at increasing risk of crop failure. Droughts continue to play a part, and have been increasing in frequency and severity in Africa [since 1951](https://rmets.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/joc.3875). But lesser-known weather events are also a concern. Varying frost patterns (particularly in the highlands of Ethiopia and Eritrea) can cause total failure, and soil quality is under threat. Even traditionally fertile regions like Chile are in danger, with [research ](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/gcb.13959)finding a 1.3Â°C  temperature increase would lead to an 87% drop in food production, due to increased pestilence.

Low-income farmers rely on their crops to survive. A failure can mean disaster, especially in countries with little-to-no governmental support. In Africa, "[70 percent of the population is dependent on rain-fed, smallholder agriculture.](https://news.trust.org/item/20161117104624-jxar7/)" We must find a risk-management solution that is both scalable and sustainable, to ensure the livelihood of small-scale farmers in danger of climate change.

# What is microinsurance?

Microinsurance steps in where governments cannot. Farmers pay a risk-adjusted premium, and receive aid if their crops fail. The actual mechanism differs between implementations, but most current programs involve an insurance agency or co-operative that manages the scheme.

This is a problem for very low-income farmers in small communities, who cannot afford any overhead in an insurance scheme. Cotton farmers in Mali live on [one Australian dollar per day](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/nov/14/mali-cotton-farmer-fair-trade), so it's too much to expect premiums to cover the administration costs of an insurer, or to pay the wages of employees.

Insurers may also be unable to service vast, remote areas, or may lack the knowledge of local communities to meet their needs. A [report from the Philippines ](https://dirp4.pids.gov.ph/ris/dps/pidsdps0625.pdf)found that "few MFIs or NGOs possess the human resources necessary to undertake insurance operations".

These issues mean that existing schemes aren't suitable for farmers who are remotely located or on very low incomes.

# A new approach

An answer to these problems is peer-to-peer microinsurance. Communities around the world could establish their own schemes, tailored to individual needs. Each member of the scheme would contribute premiums, but no middle-man could take a cut. The funds raised would only be distributed to members when needed.

Peer-to-peer systems allow microinsurance that is affordable and without overhead. Each community can address its own concerns, with local knowledge and relationships taking a central role. This fixes the addressing the major concer

The most pressing concern in a peer-to-peer system is governance. How could we ensure that bad actors can't unfairly benefit from communal funds? We should focus on a democratic approval model. Each member receives one vote, which is used when making decisions for the fund pool. When a member requests a payout, all others vote, with a majority required for approval. To add and remove members from the scheme, a supermajority is necessary, with all but one member required to approve the action.

An approval system offloads the problem of governance onto existing relationships and reputations. Rather than a faceless insurer deciding if a claim is valid, local communities can rely on their own systems of trust. Members are incentivised to approve claims and avoid reprisal in the future. Requiring a supermajority for contentious decisions ensures that disputes between members can't easily affect the scheme.

Another downside to peer-to-peer systems is a lack of independent appraisal. A possible solution is the yield-protection model. Under this scheme, members are insured at a percentage of their expected yield. At the beginning of a growing season, the members will together agree on a projected price for their crops, and declare the amount each will grow based on past results. If the actual output for a member is less than expected, they are paid the projected price multiplied by the difference. This mathematical approach removes the need for inspectors to calculate payouts.

A peer-to-peer system is not without shortcomings. The most concerning is the risk of community-scale failure. If a natural disaster were to affect all members of the scheme, the pool could not cover everyone. Encouraging inter-community co-operation would lessen this risk.

# Conclusion

The threat of climate change requires solutions to crop failure risk for low-income farmers. Existing microinsurance schemes are ineffective for those with very low earnings, due to overhead cost. Instead, a peer-to-peer system could help communities manage their risk.

In my next post, I will present a technical design for implementing such a scheme.
