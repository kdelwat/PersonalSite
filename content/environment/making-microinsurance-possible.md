As climate change begins to take hold, subsistence farmers in low-income regions of the world are at increasing risk of crop failure. Droughts continue to play a part, and have been increasing in frequency and severity in Africa [since 1951](https://rmets.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/joc.3875). But lesser-known weather events are also a concern. Varying frost patterns (particularly in the highlands of Ethiopia and Eritrea) can cause total failure, and soil quality is under threat. Even traditionally fertile regions like Chile are in danger, with [research ](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/gcb.13959)finding a 1.3Â°C  temperature increase would lead to an 87% drop in food production, due to increased pestilence.

Low-income farmers rely on their crops to survive. A failure can mean disaster, especially in countries with little-to-no governmental support. In Africa, "[70 percent of the population is dependent on rain-fed, smallholder agriculture.](https://news.trust.org/item/20161117104624-jxar7/)"

Microinsurance schemes step in where governments cannot. Through a risk-adjusted premium, farmers are provided aid if their crops fail.
