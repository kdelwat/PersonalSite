For years, I've personally struggled with eating meat. I _knew_ that conditions in factory farms were bad. I _knew_ that farmed animals contributed to climate change on a massive scale. But meat tasted good, and I was willing to turn a blind eye and repress the unease I felt.

This all changed, funnily enough, while watching an episode of _Gourmet Farmer_ on TV. For the first time ever, I saw someone kill a chicken for food. It seems strange that I could have gone so long without, but I'd never wanted to know. I didn't want to stop eating meat. But seeing that chicken's decapitated body flail autonomously in violent contractions unsettled me on a profound level.

I started thinking about meat. I could no longer pretend that what I ate hadn't once been a living being. And at the same time, I had become interested in animal psychology and consciousness. As I worked through piles of news reports and articles, the proposition of animals being much smarter than we take for granted loomed larger.

Finally, I knew that it was time to make a decision. This led me to Foer's book. I'd heard of it before as something of a balanced look at meat consumption, with arguments for and against, and looked to it for moral answers. I was almost searching for excuses to eat meat. But every single page revealed more and more horrific details. I'd known that factory farming was bad. Everyone does. But I find it hard to believe someone could read this book and go back to eating meat. Foer's descriptions are stark and haunting, providing a cross-section of the entire meat industry and its systematic abuse of animals. It's not as bad as you expect. It's worse.

I particularly appreciated Foer's forays into the environmental and health impacts of meat consumption. I had expected, for example, that cutting down meat consumption would have some impact on the environment, but I didn't expect it to be the single leading cause of global warming. And the effects of meat on human health, while less understood, are also cause for concern.

The progression of the book is striking. Foer dives into the gory details from the onset, but tempers them throughout with stories of hope: farmers who treat their cattle like family, or who breed heirloom turkeys in an ethical way. As the reader progresses through the book, and are turned away from factory farming, they come to see these small glimmers as a way out, a loophole through which they can continue to eat meat. I know I did. Until the end of the book comes as a hammer blow: all of these farms are failing. In an economic climate dominated by mechanised agriculture, it's impossible to make a living selling ethical food. Foer drives home the point that it's _impossible_ for these farms to be completely moral: the best-run farm in the United States must still send its birds to a cruel and unsanitary slaughterhouse. This is an incredibly compelling case against "ethical" meat consumption.

The single problem with this book is its pretense at being anything other than a case for vegetarianism. Foer goes to great pains to talk about the way food, and meat in particular, creates and maintains stories throughout family and friends. But despite his pleas that the book doesn't specifically advocate vegetarianism, there is real counterargument presented. Maybe this is because, as I believe, such an argument doesn't exist. I understand Foer's decision to take this approach and avoid scaring off already-committed carnivores, but it feels a little dishonest.

Regardless, this book was the answer I was searching for. The evidence was there, and I couldn't unlearn what I'd read. I was left with no choice: I had to stop eating meat. And I have. For a book designed to promote vegetarianism, it couldn't be more effective. It honestly changed my life, and I hope it changes many others.
