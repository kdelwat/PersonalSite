# Notes: Simple Made Easy by Rich Hickey

Simple: one-braided (no interleaving)

Complex: many-braided

Easy: from Latin "to lie near",

Hard: strong

Simple things fulfill one role / task or one concept

Simple doesn't mean only one object / operation

"Easy": we think it means close, familiar, but that means can't learn anything signfi. new. Third aspect is being near to our capabilities. Easy is relative, simple is objective

People say simple when they mean easy

We code using constructs, but in the business of artifacts. Infatuated with constructs / programmer convenience, but it doesn't really matter.

Things can only be reliable if we understand them, therefore they must be simple

Can only keep a few things in mind at same time. More complex = more braiding, so we need to keep more things in mind. Complexity limits understanding and reliability.

Need to be able to reason about program to change it.

Complicating constructs can be easy to use, well-documented, and familiar. Incidental complexity arises from usinng them

Simplicity helps understanding, debuggng, refactoring, flexibility - decisions become independent

Parentheses are hard in common lisp - because they are complex. They're used for calls and for grouping (do two things). c.f. clojure, which adds vectors for grouping. Then parentheses become easy.

Complect: archaic word meaning to interleave, entwine.

Modular software/partitioning doesn't imply simplicity if they all know about each other.

State complects value and time. It is easy but not simple
