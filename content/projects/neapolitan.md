CSS frameworks often sacrifice freedom of styling for ease-of-use.

Neapolitan is a different kind of framework, allowing rapid development of
responsive, mobile-first designs without imposing default styles. The use of
Sass mixins allows for purely semantic HTML, aiding readability and
accessibility for human and robot alike.

The framework is built on the Sass CSS preprocessor, allowing zero-overhead
styling when needed. Documentation is autogenerated using Sassdoc.
