# Lexeme

_Available on [GitHub](https://github.com/kdelwat/lexeme)._

Lexeme is a command-line constructed language word database, generation, and
declension program. It has a number of useful features:

-   Words are saved in a searchable and filterable SQLite database.
-   Generate words according to a basic syllable rule, or use advanced rules to specify unique patterns for different parts of speech.
-   Apply custom phonotactics rules during word generation.
-   Tag words with custom fields, for example gender or vowel harmony type, and filter the database according to any field.
-   Batch generate words from file.
-   Set declension rules and autodecline or conjugate words to different tenses, aspects, cases, or any other desired form.
-   Automatically convert words to their phonetic representation through specified rules.
-   Export database to a csv file compatible with [PolyGlot](https://draquet.github.io/PolyGlot/) or spreadsheet software.
-   Easy file-based configuration.
