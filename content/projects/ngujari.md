The hobby of "conlanging" involves designing languages for fictional speakers.
This interactive site outlines the grammar of the invented Ngujari language,
including features like a searchable lexicon and hoverable definitions.

The site uses Pandoc with custom Python filters to build content from Markdown
files.
