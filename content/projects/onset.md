Onset is a web-app which realistically simulates the phonological processes of
word evolution. This has applications in linguistics research and language
construction.

A list of words in phonetic notation is evolved through multiple generations,
and the processes applied are displayed in terms of linguistic notation. Other
features include orthographic transcription and reverse evolution.

Onset is built in two independent parts. The front-end is written in Javascript
using the Vue framework for reactive interfaces, while the back-end simulation
engine is written in Python using the Flask server framework.
