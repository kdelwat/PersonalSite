# Coda

_Available on [GitHub](https://github.com/kdelwat/coda)._

Preparing reference grammars is an essential part of linguistic research. Coda
is a service which simplifies the creation of professional-looking reference
grammars from plain text sources.

The front-end of the app is built with React, which eases the process of
building declarative Javascript user interfaces. The back-end is written in
Python, using Pandoc with custom filters and XeTeX to generate beautiful PDF
documents.
