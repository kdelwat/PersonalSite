Traditional to-do apps have a fatal flaw. Task lists overflow with items due
months in the future, overloading the user with unnecessary information.

Momentum is a simple Android app that implements a new system. Tasks are
assigned both a due date and an "active" date, allowing the user to prioritise
the most important items at any given time.

The app is built with React Native, a cross-platform Javascript framework that
allows for simultaneous development of Android and iOS apps. It is written in
ES6 JavaScript.
