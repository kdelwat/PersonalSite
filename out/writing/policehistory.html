                    <h1>Playing with Fire</h1>

<p>After the colony of Argentière was founded in 1807, policing was the responsibility of the government of Angourie. But the officers, having been brought in on a rotating roster of one-year residencies, were widely detested by the population. There were a number of forces contributing to the hatred.</p>

<p>Firstly, the island had been quick to develop a national identity. Its residents did not see themselves as belonging to Angourie, or the colonies of Yadira as a whole, but to their own community. This was helped in part by the large immigrant populations who flocked to the island for work; their culture and languages were a barrier to integration with the largely white European colony on the mainland. Argentière also had one of the largest populations of “natives” - those born on the island rather than France or another of her colonies. Having never experienced the motherland, these settlers built their identities locally. Secondly, the one-year residency allowed little time for socialisation or understanding of the island’s unique culture. Since officers did their stint and then returned home to their family and friends in the mainland, there was little incentive to reach out into the community. Those who did were denigrated by their commanders, and encouraged to spend their off-time instead in the officer’s club at the police barracks (which didn’t help the local perception of the visiting men as prone to drunkenness). Finally, since the posting was one of the least desired in the colony, due to the island’s isolation, many senior officers assigned to it were able to pull rank or call in favours and avoid being shipped off. Those that remained were fresh junior officers, inexperienced, scared, and unable to deescalate a situation non-violently.</p>

<p>The tensions only increased as time went on. It was a vicious feedback loop: heavy-handedness on the part of the officers stoked community fear and outrage, but any acts of rebellion precipitated harsher punishments. The force became the law. Many settlers were arrested for crimes they did not commit, on the basis of rumours or even personal enmities. By 1860, the island’s increasingly nationalist population had had enough. They petitioned the state government to grant them their own law enforcement organisation, which would be more suited to the culture and fairer to residents. While the state fought hard to oppose the request, the citizens found an unlikely ally: the police force themselves. A series of anonymous attacks on officers made for a hostile environment, and culminated in the bombing of the Officer’s Club in Argentière on November 2, 1860. A load of fertilizer was set alight outside the club by unknown attackers; the subsequent blast killing 8 officers and wounded dozens. Fearing further attacks, and reprisals by groups of officers, the police force lent its support to the plan.</p>

<p>In March 1862, the long-awaited community police force, comprised of and trained by locals, took control of routine policework in the city. They had jurisdiction over petty crime, like theft, and rapid response when needed. Yet the state government refused to give up investigative powers, fearing it would extinguish their ability to quash dissent. Thus the gendarmerie was born; made up of loyalists from Angourie, and tasked with detective work and investigating “treasonous activities”. In contrast to the former state police outpost, the gendarmes were volunteers. However, rather than tempering their behaviour or encouraging those who wanted to integrate with the population, the gendarmes who willingly stayed were more vicious than ever, made paranoid by the attacks of 1860 and 1861.</p>

<p>This dual system was a constant source of struggle for the next forty years. While the community police force was well-recieved, legally its hands were tied. It could not even execute a search warrant; all high-powered police work was the sole domain of the gendarmerie, who didn’t take kindly to what they derogatorily called the “fruit-cops” (since many theft cases on the island involved stolen fruit trees). Pleas for more power for the rapidly-professionalising community police fell on deaf ears. Officially, the locals were to “enforce law and order in the city, and foster goodwill in the community”, as police chief Durant Eager noted in 1904, while the gendarmerie was a “purely investigative body, which… helped, rather than supplanted”. In practice, this was not the case. Were the police to take any sort of case beyond petty crime, the gendarmerie would swoop in and take control on the grounds of national security. This led to much enmity between the two forces; resentment, despite the temporary defusement of tensions when the community force was announced, only continued to grow.</p>

<p>The chief criticism of the gendarmerie were that they were too political. The Angourie police chief, and that of each other state on the mainland, were elected officials. This meant that they were often partisan and beholden to the government in power, which affected their perception as non-neutral. Since the gendarmerie were investigative, they performed almost all of the arrests for politically-charged crimes such as treason, sedition, and insulting the motherland (France, an act which was still illegal until 1926). The head gendarme stationed on Argentière was appointed directly by the Angourie chief, and was typically both high-status and highly-political.</p>

<p>The most infamous head gendarme was Lamar Raison. Previously the police chief of Avignon, the 65-year-old was nearing retirement, and had a long and storied career under his belt. The federated government at the time, led by the Partie Française, was growing concerned with what Prime Minister Henri Godot noted in an internal memo as “sedition and unrest on Argentière… an uneasy and unruly populace, who need to be disciplined early to prevent further rebellion.” They had seen Raison’s success in the mainland state of Avignon, where he had successfully decreased violent crime by 30% through a combination of harsh sentencing, detention without reason, and increased powers to compel witnesses. Despite critics who decried his heavy-handed tactics, they were genuinely successful in their stated aim, and Raison had garnered favour with both the federal government and the inhabitants of Avignon. In 1906 he was instilled in Argentière for a two-year service, prior to his retirement, charged with “taking back law and order from the natives, with whatever means possible^[Raison, L. “La vie de la Justice”, 1912]”. Immediately, this meant taking even more control from the police force, who could no longer even question a subject without a gendarme present, thus hampering them to the point of uselessness. Some of their members walked off the job in strike in March 1907, but their demands went unmet, and they returned to work two weeks later with their tail between their legs. The fact was that the community police force had become little more than ornamental. All real policing was the responsibility of the gendarmerie.</p>

<p>This fraught relationship eventually came to a head on May Day, 1908, when large protests filled the Grand Place in support of worker’s rights and an end to the central government’s controversial labour policies, in which unions were required to allow “government representatives”, little more than spies, to attend their meetings and executive discussions, and where industries were tightly regulated in their hiring practices. While the protests started peacefully, unionists quickly turned violent, smashing windows and burning effigies of the government and their representatives. After a fountain in the square was toppled, the gendarmerie was given orders to move in. But the crowd quickly noticed that they were ignoring the actual instigators of violence, even going so far as to walk past a group of rioters destroying a government office without a second glance. They were instead targeting prominent union leaders, who gathered in the center of the square. As this became apparent, the leaders, including the head of the police union who had just finished an address to the crowd, called for police assistance. The community police, who had become further and further frustrated with the state of affairs, was still hesitant to act for fear of reprisal. The gendarmes were better trained and armed, and known for violent arrests. Yet a small group of deputies decided to take matters into their own hands.</p>

<p>Gustav Certain, Blais Gourdin, and Norm Delanoy were officers who knew the potential unfairness of the gendarmerie all too well. Once assigned to the investigative division of the Eaubonne department, they had made a name for themselves as vigilant and detail-oriented detectives. Their rap-sheet reflected their reputation; a long line of arrests established them as some of the best in the business, even if they were forced to hand their evidence and perpetrators to the gendarmerie for prosecution. But Raison, as one of his first actions, had disbanded the investigative units of all metropolitan departments. The once-successful detectives had been relegated to desk duties, and resented that fact immensely. This resentment had manifested in increased union involvement - Certain had risen to head representative for Eaubonne, and Gourdin secretary.</p>

<p>On the day of the protest, they found themselves alongside the union leader, since La Place fell within their jurisdiction. They were among the first to notice the encroaching gendarmes and their political targets. Gourdin told the leader immediately, and conferred with the others. They resolved that they would do whatever it took to protect their fellow unionists. The spark that started the fire occurred 15 minutes later. Two gendarmes approached Iva Bertram, head of the families branch of the union, and attempted to detain her. Certain and Delanoy pushed between the aggressors and Bertram, and urged them to stop the arrests. The gendarmes told them in no uncertain terms that they had absolute authority, and any resistance would itself be grounds for arrest. In response, the two officers moved to arrest the gendarmes, for what Certain later described as “opposing peace and unlawful detention for political purposes”^[Le Nouvel Observateur, 1908]. When the gendarmes resisted, a scuffle broke out, with both groups fighting hand-to-hand in anger and frustration. Quickly, more gendarmes appeared and restrained the officers. While the official account disputes the claim, multiple witnesses stated that they then proceeded to viciously beat the officers while they were held on the ground, using both their bodies and batons. Gourdin, despite the protests of other officials around him, drew his rifle and fired on the gendarmes.</p>

<p>Two were wounded, a bullet to the leg for one, and to the shoulder of another. The gendarmes returned fire, killing Gourdin immediately and wounding five other citizens, two critically. One would later die in hospital of septicemia. The surrounding gendarmes saw their opportunity, and moved on the podium. Ultimately, they arrested 34 citizens and police officers for a variety of trumped-up charges.</p>

<p>The attack was received very poorly by the vast majority of Argentière. All political parties with representation in the parliament, including the Conservatives, who had previously supported the gendarmerie, condemned their actions in a joint resolution and called on the state’s agents to leave the island. For a period of two days in August, the island’s government seriously considered, albeit behind closed doors, an order for the police force to expel the gendarmes. After the Yawirran central government received word of this plan, they knew that compromise was needed to avoid further conflict, and potentially the loss of control of the island altogether.</p>

<p>On the 3rd of May, the central government presented a draft agreement to the Argentière government. Known as the May Day Agreement, it outlined a series of reforms to the gendarmerie and police force in an effort to allow for peaceful coexistence. While cynics on the island declared it “a desperate attempt to cling to power”^[Fourier, M. “Le Cri des Cochons”, L’Indépendant, 1908] through the gendarmerie, others, including the majority of the parliament, were more welcoming of the proposal. Among its pledges were:</p>

<ul>
<li>Devolution of some investigative powers to the community police force, who would be permitted to investigate low-level crimes independently</li>
<li>The appointment of a community police force representative to all investigations of a political matter, to ensure the good conduct of the gendarmerie</li>
<li>Reparations paid by both sides for the damage caused by the May Day conflict</li>
</ul>

<p>The last point was the most contentious, since to the community police force it implied guilt and shared responsibility, when in fact they felt the gendarmerie was wholly responsible. Nevertheless, the police chief, after meeting with the island’s government, announced on May 5th that the community police would sign the Agreement. The gendarmerie lacked the agency to decide for themselves, and despite the disgruntled reaction of many of their members, were compelled to sign by the central government.</p>

<p>The May Day Agreement ushered in a period of tense but hopeful reconciliation. While initial efforts to send community police representatives to high-profile investigations were less fruitful (with deputy police chief Russ Sonnier grumbling that “the gendarmes would prefer us smile for the camera, then sit in the corner deaf and mute”^[Interview with Lafelle Martin, 1909]), over time the relationship warmed. While the two forces could never be considered friendly, a number of decades passed without significant conflict, and coupled with an increase in the number of Argentière natives accepted into the gendarmerie, this gave the impression of serious progress.</p>

<p>Once again, however, the relationship was to sour. In March 1952, mass street demonstrations saw upwards of 200,000 citizens protesting the lack of central government funding and self-management of internal affairs. In response to small-scale rioting, the Chief Minister of Angourie, Pierre Lazard, deployed the gendarmerie to maintain order, despite its more subdued role as an investigative force over the past decade. The gendarmes were less familiar with on-the-ground police work, and bore the brunt of the protestors’ anger. With conflict growing, including an attack on a group of riot police by protestors wielding Molotov cocktails which left one dead and three hospitalised, the gendarmerie cracked down. When the community police force refused to assist in arresting protesters, the gendarmerie expelled their representatives and took back full control of political investigations.</p>

<p>When Prime Minister Antoine Pinay afforded Argentière territory status on the 15th of May, he ordered these investigations closed as a gesture of goodwill. But the stories of beatings and heavy-handedness had cast an indelible stain on the gendarmes, which persisted even through their incorporation into the federal gendarmerie (with the state of Angourie no longer responsible for policing the island). Many residents of the island became openly hostile towards the force, and throughout the second half of the century there were a number of incidents which further undermined trust. By the 1990s, there was so little goodwill for the gendarmes that the UPG (a major political party) had even formally announced in its platform that they would expel the gendarmerie from the island altogether.</p>

<p>The first century of policing in Argentière could thus be characterised as a tension between the locals, who demanded representation and self-determination, and the external government (first of Angourie, then Yawirra). This tension would be tested for a final time in 1994, when the island revolted as one and finally achieved independence.</p>
