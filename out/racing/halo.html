                    <h1>For the Halo</h1>

<p>In my (limited) time watching Formula One, I&rsquo;ve never encountered a change from
management that has resulted in such polarisation of fans as the Halo.</p>

<p>{{&lt; figure src=&ldquo;/images/Halo.jpg&rdquo; title=&ldquo;The Halo on Haas&rsquo; challenger (Sutton Images)&rdquo; alt=&ldquo;The Halo device on the Haas F1 car&rdquo;&gt;}}</p>

<p>So far, the reaction seems to be predominantly negative, but fans either love it
or hate it. In this post, I&rsquo;ll go through the major parts of the debate and
outline my reasons for supporting the Halo&rsquo;s introduction.</p>

<h1>Effectiveness</h1>

<p>For me the key question surrounding the Halo is whether it effectively improves
safety for drivers. The FIA&rsquo;s Formula One strategy group announced in 2017 that
it would be mandatory on cars this year &ldquo;to introduce additional frontal
protection&rdquo; for drivers. The device aims to provide a barrier in the event of
flying debris, particularly wheels (as in Buemi&rsquo;s <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xwoCLiyzdgU">2010 crash in the Chinese
GP</a>), and in possible freak
collisions.</p>

<p>According to an FIA report:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Centring on three significant major risk types, car-to-car contact,
car-to-environment contact and external objects, tests revealed that in the
case of car-to-car incidents the Halo was able to withstand 15x the static
load of the full mass of the car and was able to significantly reduce the
potential for injuries.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Cynical fans point to the fact that the FIA has been under pressure to improve
safety in the sport after the death of Jules Bianchi in 2015, and a subsequent
lawsuit by his family. They claim &ldquo;safety theatre&rdquo;, since the Halo would have
been unable to prevent the circumstances of his death. But this seems
short-sighted: we shouldn&rsquo;t act only retroactively on safety, when we could
proactively prevent deaths.</p>

<p>Granted, there are limitations to the Halo&rsquo;s design. Despite the FIA&rsquo;s claim
that it gives &ldquo;an increased net level of protection against small debris,&rdquo; the
design is clearly focused on larger objects, and detached components flying at
high-velocity could still strike the driver.</p>

<h1>Usability</h1>

<p>No matter how good the effectiveness in preventing a certain class of incidents,
if the Halo were to introduce further safety issues it would be a foolish
errand. This was the main reason for the delay in implementation from 2017 to
2018.</p>

<p>A primary concern is visibility, since the main support strut bisects the
driver&rsquo;s view. However, this doesn&rsquo;t appear to be a problem for drivers.
According to Daniel Ricciardo:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;It might sound silly, but I don&rsquo;t notice it. Getting in the car and getting
out obviously you do &hellip;, but on track it seemed fine.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Fernando Alonso agrees:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;When I see the pictures I see the halo in the middle of the vision, but when
driving for whatever reason you are focused on the long distance, you are not
that focused on the middle part of the chassis. In the corners obviously you
are watching left and right of the centre pylon so it&rsquo;s absolutely no
problem.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Another concern is that it may prevent easy exit from the car in the case of a
crash, with Carlos Sainz saying that &ldquo;Itâ€™s also difficult to get in and out of
the car because of it.&rdquo; However, FIA safety tests showed that it <a href="https://www.autosport.com/f1/news/131095/six-key-myths-about-f1-halo-device-busted">improves
exits</a>
from over-turned cars, and George Russell (Mercedes&rsquo; junior driver) noted no
problems getting out of the car after a few days of practice.</p>

<h1>Aesthetics</h1>

<p>While a personal opinion, it&rsquo;s hard to argue that the Halo is anything other
than ugly. Teams like Williams have done an admirable job integrating the device
with their livery, and such attempts minimise its aesthetic impact. Other teams
like Mercedes seem to have put no effort whatsoever into looks.</p>

<p>{{&lt; figure src=&ldquo;/images/Williams2018.jpg&rdquo; title=&ldquo;Williams&rsquo; 2018 car&rdquo; alt=&ldquo;Williams&rsquo; 2018 car&rdquo;&gt;}}
{{&lt; figure src=&ldquo;/images/Mercedes2018.jpg&rdquo; title=&ldquo;Mercedes&rsquo; 2018 car&rdquo; alt=&ldquo;Mercedes&rsquo; 2018 car&rdquo;&gt;}}</p>

<h1>Conclusion</h1>

<p>The three key dimensions of the Halo debate are effectiveness, usability, and
aesthetics. FIA safety tests have conclusively demonstrated that the device adds
considerable safety to the current cars, and interviews with drivers show few
negative effects in terms of safety. The only drawback is the look of the
device, although this can be minimised with clever styling.</p>

<p>Ultimately I think it comes down to a question of priorities. Those against the
Halo for aesthetic reasons are saying they prioritise the look of the cars over
the safety of the drivers, a viewpoint I find callous. If we can save one life
over ten or twenty years, that&rsquo;s worth any amount of aesthetic damage. Fans are
attracted to Formula One for the engineeering and racing as well as the looks;
and these won&rsquo;t change. In fact, the Halo will add additional challenge to both
and allow teams to further innovate.</p>

<p>Importantly, the device is only a temporary solution. Work in Formula One and
Indycar on a protective windshield continues, and if it can withstand the same
level of force as the Halo seems like a more pleasing device. But for now, there
is no better alternative. The Halo is a big step forward for safety in the
sport.</p>
