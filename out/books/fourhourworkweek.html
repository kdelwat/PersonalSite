                    <p><em><sup>5</sup>&frasl;<sub>10</sub>. An inspiring look at an ideal lifestyle but with a less-than-desirable path to getting there.</em></p>

<p>I liked half of this book.</p>

<p>In the beginning, Ferriss makes the case for &ldquo;lifestyle design&rdquo;: an alternate life path to the usual <em>work hard, save, retire</em> truism. It revolves around &ldquo;mini-retirements&rdquo;, sabbaticals spent working abroad. The vision is no doubt inspiring, and a life most would find appealing. He does well to extol its virtues, and I was left feeling motivated and ready to take action.</p>

<p>My problem lies with the rest of the book. After detailing the end-goal, I found his plan to get there (a plan he followed himself) to be bordering on immoral. It looks like this:</p>

<ol>
<li>Automate and outsource your job until you&rsquo;re doing the bare minimum possible.</li>
<li>Negotiate a remote-work agreement.</li>
<li>Spend your time away from work, which is now outsourced, working on a &ldquo;muse&rdquo;: a business which will rocket you to success.</li>
</ol>

<p>I take offence at this for a couple of reasons. The first is that the method involves dumping your work onto the less fortunate. He recommends virtual assistants in India who will do anything to make you happy. It feels like his ladder of success is built on rungs made up of other people. The second is his requirements for muses: businesses with a 10x margin, which sell physical goods, with little to no effort expended after automating all major workflows. He particularly recommends reselling wholesale goods under a premium name. If your goal is to get rich, by all means follow this advice. But it adds less than zero value to the world. We don&rsquo;t need more middlemen.</p>

<p>The author is ultra-successful, and it shows. The book is written from a point of view that tries its best to be uplifting but sometimes comes across as almost cynical. I was left with the uncanny feeling that everything Ferriss recommends in the book was being applied to me. I was the sheep buying in to his brand.</p>

<p>The problems of his approach seem lost on Ferriss. Maybe he sleeps well at night. I wouldn&rsquo;t.</p>
