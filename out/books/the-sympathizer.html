                    <h1>The Sympathizer by Viet Thanh Nguyen&rdquo;</h1>

<p><em><sup>8</sup>&frasl;<sub>10</sub>. A deceptively deep critique of the West&rsquo;s treatment of refugees, framed by an entertaining story.</em></p>

<p>Viet Thanh Nguyen&rsquo;s Pulitzer Prize-winning novel purports to be an espionage thriller, set against the backdrop of the Vietnam War. The story, framed as the jail-cell confession of an unnamed protagonist, follows his escape to the United States after the fall of Saigon, and his dual allegiances to the North and South Vietnamese administrations.</p>

<p>But this plot is nowhere near the main focus of the novel. Nguyen uses it masterfully as a tool to dissect and critique the plight of the refugee in America, and by extension the West as a whole. Every action, every event, allows him to expound upon his furiously lucid views. The story&rsquo;s superficial veneer provides the platform for a nuanced and meaningful contribution to post-war literature.</p>

<p>Nguyen is particularly critical of the lack of integration for new arrivals, who spend the majority of the time in an insular community with no external support. Their sole American champion is painted as a slimy politician who views the group opportunistically as a new voting bloc. The timing of this 2015 novel couldn&rsquo;t be more salient: the parallels between post-Vietnam integration and today&rsquo;s international refugee crisis are striking.</p>

<p>Leaving aside thematic considerations, Nguyen&rsquo;s writing is an excellent reflection of the psyche of the narrator, whose dry humour shines through in the darkest of situations. It&rsquo;s not often that such a heavy book could be considered laugh-out-loud funny, but Nguyen manages just fine. His exploration of Vietnam-era &ldquo;free love&rdquo; relationships is also a refreshing take on romantic tropes.</p>

<p>My only criticism of the novel is that sometimes, despite a number of very original deviations, the espionage plot strode into clich√© territory. This was a particular problem with the conclusion of the book.</p>

<p>Ultimately, though, the plot is enjoyable but irrelevant. What really shines is Nguyen&rsquo;s views on refugees, and the difference between East and West as a whole. This is an important book for our modern times.</p>
