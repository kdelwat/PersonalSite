                    <h1>Tribe of Mentors by Tim Ferriss</h1>

<p><em><sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>10</sub>. A low-effort cash-in on his other works.</em></p>

<p>I&rsquo;ll admit, I went on a bit of a Tim Ferriss bender for a while there. I read <em>The 4-Hour Work Week</em> (iffy), <em>Tools of Titans</em> (great), and then dipped in and out of his other books (<em>4-Hour Body</em>, <em>4-Hour Chef</em>). This review is more of an analysis of why Ferriss&rsquo; writing is so damn addictive than it is an actual look at his latest work, <em>Tribe of Mentors</em>, but I should probably get that out of the way first.</p>

<p><em>Tribe of Mentors</em> is a waste of time, and it really pissed me off. Ferriss positions it as a sequel to <em>Tools of Titans</em>, an in-depth look at advice from the best in the world, but then strips out everything that made the original so great. The detailed, considered question and answer format, that extracted meaningful information from each interviewee? Gone, in favour of a list of nine canned questions sent to each subject via email. The author&rsquo;s own interludes with practical and realistic advice? Gone as well. There really is nothing to this book - it&rsquo;s a list of quick email responses to a set of standard questions. Ferris does include a handful of non-interview sections, but they&rsquo;re actually just copies of emails he received from subjects who <em>turned down</em> his interview request. While he frames it as an exercise in learning from failure, there&rsquo;s a word for these sections, and for the book as a whole: <em>lazy</em>. Seriously, come on. This was one of the most mediocre follow-ups I&rsquo;ve ever read. Avoid it.</p>

<p>On, then, to Ferriss&rsquo; writing. The more I consumed of his work (and I indeed consumed it voraciously), the more I started to notice a pattern. It&rsquo;s most obvious in his earlier books, but it&rsquo;s still there, subtly, in the more recent.</p>

<p>First, Ferriss tries to inspire the reader. Stage one is an anecdote about success and happiness. These aspirational stories mostly revolve around time (and, weirdly, stand-up paddleboarding), and having more of it. He knows his driven but time-poor audience well. Next, stage two presents a process of discovery. He explains how he came to the conclusions he is presenting, the experts he relied on, and any failures he experienced along the way. Stage three is details. Ferriss lists as unambiguously as possible the concrete steps that the reader can take to put his ideas into action. The final stage is a list of related resources, and, crucially, a list of products that can help the reader achieve the goal first presented back in stage one.</p>

<p>No matter whether he is talking about food, health, or business, this pattern appears over and over again. There&rsquo;s a reason for that: it&rsquo;s wildly addictive. I should know, because it trapped me in his works. Stage one sets up the ideal: the reader is inspired to imagine a future self. If only <em>they</em> could be paddle-boarding somewhere exotic, instead of on the bus to work (that specific example may or may not be a slight bitterness on my part). They enter stage two ready to know just how on Earth they can fulfill this goal. Here, Ferriss appeals to authority. Consulting experts shows just how serious he is in acting scientifically, and proves (maybe) that he isn&rsquo;t just making it all up. Stage three is the clincher: a list of concrete recommendations which is actually quite helpful. If his books were all stage three, they&rsquo;d be far more valuable. This is where his advice is genuinely useful; the rest of the book is merely padding.</p>

<p>Stage four, however, is subtly brilliant. The reader is now in a hyped-up state, inspired to make the changes just discussed. They are presented with a list of products and resources they <em>need</em>, if they want to make it happen. Herein lies the problem: Ferriss is seriously wealthy; far more so than the average reader. Many of these products lie outside their means. So if they take his advice, but can&rsquo;t afford to go &ldquo;all-in&rdquo;, and it fails, it&rsquo;s their own fault. They didn&rsquo;t follow his advice exactly. As he <a href="https://tim.blog/2011/01/21/housecleaning-and-clarifications-blog-content-4hb-corrections-competition-winners-slow-carb-mistakes-and-more/">laments on his blog</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>If you haven’t had blood tests done, I don’t want to hear that the diet doesn’t work.<br />
If you aren’t measuring inches or haven’t measured bodyfat % with an accurate tool (BodPod, etc. and NOT bodyfat scales), I don’t want to hear that the diet doesn’t work.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>If you can&rsquo;t afford the BodPod, well, that&rsquo;s not <em>his</em> fault.</p>

<p>Some of Ferriss&rsquo; advice is great. But what he fails to realise is that most of it, whether it be his approach to fitness, mentorship, or learning to cook, <em>only works if you&rsquo;re already rich</em>. No-one else can afford to hire a professional chef to condense culinary school into 48 hours. Without Ferriss&rsquo; considerable financial head-start, it&rsquo;s really hard to follow his advice.</p>

<p>Why, then, do I keep coming back to it? It&rsquo;s the pattern of his writing: the initial jolt of excitement, the appeal to experts, the concrete recommendations, and, yes, the list of products which fuels my consumerist impulses. I suspect this same pattern has lured in many of his other fans.</p>

<p>But as <em>Tribe of Mentors</em> as shown, sometimes he slips. Sometimes he just writes a really lazy and crappy book. I like to think this is my last straw. Tim Ferriss, I&rsquo;m leaving you.</p>

<p>Who am I kidding. I&rsquo;ll probably buy his next book as soon as it&rsquo;s released.</p>
