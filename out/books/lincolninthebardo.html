                    <h1>Lincoln in the Bardo by George Saunders</h1>

<p><em><sup>10</sup>&frasl;<sub>10</sub>. A masterpiece of style and character.</em></p>

<p>This book won the Man Booker prize, and it demonstrates why from the very first page.</p>

<p>The story follows Willie Lincoln, son of Abraham, as he journeys into a mystical realm halfway between life and death: the Bardo. It&rsquo;s a well-considered and original premise, but the plot sits in the background as a canvas on which Saunders can display his literary skill.</p>

<p>The writing is impeccable, a perfect emulation of historical style interspersed with a rich and unwasted vocabulary. Every word is deliberate; every line contributing to characterisation or setting. There were pages that I had to immediately show to another person, to validate my feeling of entrancement. Structurally the book is composed only of direct quotations from characters or historical accounts, but what would risk becoming gimmicky in the hands of another author allows Saunders to shine. He delves into the unreliability of witnesses, and the contrasts in experience of events which differentiate character and personality.</p>

<p>I was particularly enamoured with the book&rsquo;s characterisation. There is not one wasted person. Each has a story to tell and feels <em>unique</em>, even those furthest in the background. Their personalities are heightened, as befits the surreal nature of the story, but are always couched in plausibility. It was refreshing to find a book that steered clear of romance, and in doing so brought other deep and complex relationships to the forefront, especially that of fatherly love. It&rsquo;s an area I wish we saw more of in contemporary fiction.</p>

<p>Read this book. It will blow you away.</p>
